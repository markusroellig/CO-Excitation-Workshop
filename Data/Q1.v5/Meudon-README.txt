Bonsoir,

Here are my 2 cents with PDR4. I tried to stick to the requests for most of the "simple" updates. Some are just to long to implement and/or test.

I also provide an "extra" file, as requested by Volker. Hopefully, the header is self-explanatory, but do not hesitate to ask in case of doubt. Note that cooling and heating rates are all positives, but the name tells it all:

* Ref: "Refroidissement" => cooling
* Cho: "Chauffage" => heating

H2 cascades and gas-grain coupling are split in two, since they cool in some parts of the cloud and heat elsewhere.

Note also that I provide the full range of computed data, I.e. from Av = 0 to Av = 20 (I had cut it to 10 in previous files). The radiation field is 1 on the "back face" of the cloud. 

Give the late hour, and the (excellent) diner to take into account, I am afraid I can not do more now. Tell me tomorrow morning if you need help and/or editing.

Good night.

Jacques
